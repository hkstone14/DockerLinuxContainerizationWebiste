    <p><strong>What is Virtualization?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the
        actual hardware. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system
        simultaneously. To the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as if they are on
        their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs are unique to the guest
        virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits below it.

    <p>
        There are many reasons why people utilize virtualization in computing. To desktop users, the most common use is
        to be able to run applications meant for a different operating system without having to switch computers or
        reboot into a different system. For administrators of servers, virtualization also offers the ability to run
        different operating systems, but perhaps, more importantly, it offers a way to segment a large system into many
        smaller parts, allowing the server to be used more efficiently by a number of different users or applications
        with different needs. It also allows for isolation, keeping programs running inside of a virtual machine safe
        from the processes taking place in another virtual machine on the same host.

    <p><strong>What is Hypervisor?</strong></p>
    <p>
        A hypervisor is a program for creating and running virtual machines. Hypervisors have traditionally been split
        into two classes: type one, or "bare metal" hypervisors that run guest virtual machines directly on a system's
        hardware, essentially behaving as an operating system. Type two, or "hosted" hypervisors behave more like
        traditional applications that can be started and stopped like a normal program. In modern systems, this split is
        less prevalent, particularly with systems like KVM. KVM, short for kernel-based virtual machine, is a part of
        the Linux kernel that can run virtual machines directly, although you can still use a system running KVM virtual
        machines as a normal computer itself.

    <p><strong>What is Virtual machine?</strong></p>
    <p>
        A virtual machine is the emulated equivalent of a computer system that runs on top of another system. Virtual
        machines may have access to any number of resources: computing power, through hardware-assisted but limited
        access to the host machine's CPU and memory; one or more physical or virtual disk devices for storage; a virtual
        or real network inferface; as well as any devices such as video cards, USB devices, or other hardware that are
        shared with the virtual machine. If the virtual machine is stored on a virtual disk, this is often referred to
        as a disk image. A disk image may contain the files for a virtual machine to boot, or, it can contain any other
        specific storage needs.
